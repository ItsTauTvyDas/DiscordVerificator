 **DiscordVerificator** is a **Spigot** plugin that allows you to do player authentication using **Discord bot**.<br>

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin is **intended** to be used on **private servers** with the **manual player addition** because it involves you to manually link each player to their **Discord profile**.

 It was developed as an **alternative** for password-based authorization like `/login <password>` on servers with `online-mode` set to `false` (_in server.properties_).

 ## ü§î How it works?

This plugin enables players to **link their usernames to their Discord profiles**. <br/>

The **linking process** is **controlled by the administrator** of the server. <br/>
In order **to link** the account, the **admin** should run `/link <Player> <Discord ID>`. ([how to get discord id?](https://youtu.be/RzTWH0g2xbo?si=oQT2rCSuf6B3Z5kY))

Then, **when a player joins the server**, the **verification code appears**.<br>
To join the server, the player should run the seen command to the **Discord bot** you've configured: <br>

> [!NOTE]
> **Verification** is required **once per IP change**

> [!CAUTION]
> The plugin **will prevent a player from joining** if it wasn't linked to **Discord** profile yet:

## üíª Commands
- `/link <player> <discordId>` ‚Äî links the player to its Discord profile. ([how to get discord id?](https://youtu.be/RzTWH0g2xbo?si=oQT2rCSuf6B3Z5kY))
- `/unlink <player>` ‚Äî unlinks the player from its Discord profile.
- `/dvreload` ‚Äî reloads the plugin (_including Discord bot_).

## ‚ùó‚ùó Extra feature
Execute commands via a discord command! This is intended for small private servers. Disabled by default in the configuration!
One use case I made this for - for Switch Bedrock or any other console players
- `/mc <minecraft command>` ‚Äî make player execute command that is linked to the same user that requests this command. 
  
## üîû Permissions
- `discordVerificator.link` _(for **operators** by default)_ ‚Äî Allows to use `/link <player> <discordId>`
- `discordVerificator.unlink` _(for **operators** by default)_ ‚Äî Allows to use `/unlink <player>`
- `discordVerificator.reload` _(for **operators** by default)_ ‚Äî Allows to use `/dvreload`

## üìÑ Default config
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should replace `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` with your **Discord bot token**.<br>
> **Otherwise, nothing will work!**

## ‚òÇ Getting started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before getting started, make sure that the plugin's version is **compatible** with your server version.

1. Create a **new discord application** on <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications/">Discord Developer Portal</a><br>
![image](https://github.com/MrQuackDuck/DiscordVerificator/assets/61251075/3322da7c-95b3-4ee0-a22a-c868c5f43aae)<br>
![image](https://github.com/MrQuackDuck/DiscordVerificator/assets/61251075/fa05b770-0ad0-42a6-833e-101ba06eee41)
1. Go to the **"Bot"** tab and click on the **"Reset token"** button<br>
![image](https://github.com/MrQuackDuck/DiscordVerificator/assets/61251075/f75a5bca-a28a-42b2-aa04-479842688280)<br>
![image](https://github.com/MrQuackDuck/DiscordVerificator/assets/61251075/be31fca3-2f50-4004-a9c9-fdf076bde60d)
1. Copy the token<br>
![image](https://github.com/MrQuackDuck/DiscordVerificator/assets/61251075/f2b15ed9-5999-4093-8c78-3ee27c490c28)
1. Download the plugin from <a href="https://github.com/MrQuackDuck/DiscordVerificator/releases">Releases</a> tab or from <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discord-verificator.117794/">Spigot</a> page.
1. Put downloaded `.jar` into `./plugins` folder of your server.
1. Restart your server or enter `reload` command.
1. Go to `./plugins/DiscordVerificator` folder and open `config.yml`
1. Replace `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` with the token you've copied previously
1. Save the config and run `dvreload` command<br><br>
1. **Everything is done!** Now you can link players with the `link` command and<br> **invite** this bot **to your Discord server** (_to make them able to run `confirm <code>` command to the **Discord bot**_)
